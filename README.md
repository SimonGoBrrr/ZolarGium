# Zolargium
## What is Zolargium.
Zolargium is a small little project by me, Simon Brown.
Inspired by Sebastian Lague, the game is set on a gecko austronaut who explores space.
    Why? Why not. 
So far, the progress is relatively small, and heavily unoptimized, but then again, this is my first real Unity game.
     I still do not know how to use concepts like Compute Shaders, nor is my math knowledge the greatest (Have not even reached the trigonometry part of the curriculum), as I am quite young.

## Thank you for your attention paid to this README. I never read them, lmao.
##   Sincerely, Simon Brown. A Norwegian 16 year old, who likes to program.
P.S Fuck off stealing my code, my time was used developing this, not yours.
