Space exploration game.

This game was made by Simon Brown. (Fake Alias)
It was inspired by Sebastian Lague, and my own imagination.
This game was made purely in c# using the Unity Engine.
The game runs on Windows, MacOs and Linux! (Linux untested however Unity says it works there!)
In the game you mostly explore small and big planets, asteroids, moons. etc.
  In other words you are a bystander watching the universe do what the universe do best.
  Make planets move & shit, and explode & stuff.
Thank you for reading this README PLEASE FFS README I AM IMPORTANT. Sincerly Simon Brown.
